# WineD3D adaptations

The manifests apply to Wine9x commit
`8ab16c6c0930efc1f9138eddda7b3114d7f31e62`. Each patch and changed source file has
an exact SHA-256 identity before and after application. `prepare.py` applies the
base transaction first and the diagnostic transaction only when requested.
Compiler-prefix configuration and generated frontend import definitions remain
ordinary build inputs outside these source transformations.

The base patch preserves these existing behaviors:

- WineD3D imports the application-local `dgpugl.dll` and its WGL pixel-format
  aliases. Native DirectDraw switchers retain their Windows GDI dependencies.
- Capability detection uses a hidden 32×32 popup client area. The original
  decorated 10×10 outer window had an empty client rectangle on Windows 2000.
- The DreamGPU GL vendor receives a bounded 64 MiB translator texture-accounting
  budget. Wine otherwise guesses a RIVA128 with 4 MiB, insufficient for its
  desktop and another primary-sized surface. This is accounting, not a physical
  VRAM claim.
- D24S8 has framebuffer storage semantics without claiming depth-texture support.
  Rectangle textures and renderbuffers require the corresponding actual GL
  capabilities; unavailable types use Wine's existing padded 2D fallback.
- Failed DirectDraw surface creation records the original application descriptor
  and return location through the bounded failure-only diagnostic helper.
- Owned front/back swapchain buffers qualify for the GPU blitter even when the
  front buffer's usage flag is zero. Valid GPU source storage survives read-only
  maps; genuine partial CPU uploads propagate preparation failure. Existing
  desktop map/GetDC coherence remains in Wine.

The optional diagnostic patch instruments surface-location transitions and
selected readback/map/present boundaries. Its manifest preserves the original
numeric source-ID ordering and line numbers from the source after the base
patch, before instrumentation. The helper bounds aggregation and output; normal
builds do not include these copy counters.

Upstream Makefile bytes use CRLF. The base patch intentionally preserves them
and appends the same LF build-binding lines as the prior recipe. C sources use
LF. No fuzzy matching or silent line-ending normalization occurs here.
